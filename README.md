# Via-Point based Stochastic Trajectory Optimization

This repository contains python code for robust, gradient-free, time-optimal trajectory optimization. The optimization objectives can be arbitrary functions of the position, velocity, acceleration and total duration. The trajectories are internally constrained to respect user-defined velocity and acceleration limits.
